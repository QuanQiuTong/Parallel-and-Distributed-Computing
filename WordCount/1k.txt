Hello hello
Can you hear me as I scream your name
Hello hello
Do you meet me before I fade away
Is this the place that I call home
To find what I ve become
Walk along the path unknown
We live we love we lie
Deep in the dark I don t need the light
There s a ghost inside me
It all belongs to the other side
We live we love we lie
Hello hello
Nice to meet you voice inside my head
Hello hello
I believe you how can I forget
Is this the place that I call home
To find what I ve become
Walk along the path unknown
We live we love we lie
Deep in the dark I don t need the light
There s a ghost inside me
It all belongs to the other side
We live we love we lie

These shallow waters never met what I needed
I m letting go a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea I m breathing
Alive
Where are you now
Under the bright but faded lights
You ve set my heart on fire
Where are you now
Atlantis
Under the sea
Where are you now
Another dream
The monster s running wild inside of me
I m faded
